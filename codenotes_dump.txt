The GBC-ordering of chests ends here. All vars from now on were added on at the end by the GBA development team. There are three types of chests here:
1) Null chests that are always set to give the appearance of an empty chest
2) Chests that are defined previously, but the numbering system from the GBC team was too confusing and so instead of trying to fit the chests in their proper spots, duplicate vars were just created here.
3) HldChest1-8 were actually defined in Script_SaveBits in the GBC version, but act like normal chests, so they need to be added in Script_Treasure in the GBA version for functionality

Script_SaveBits [41 bytes of bitfield]
This struct contains bits that are controllable by the scripting engine. All values default to reset unless otherwise specified. Some bits are unused as they were unused in the GBC game, or the var has otherwise been moved/replaced.

Formatted as follows:
0xBitmask Variable = Description

The bitmask is surrounded by parentheses ( ) when the bit is actually unused in the game.
Variable names enclosed in square brackets are GBA-exclusive
All bits are reset on boot/new game, unless otherwise specified.
Note that the bit order in the source code might be opposite of what you might expect: it goes from most significant bit to least significant bit (i.e. 0x80 -> 0x01)

The first section contains bits related to GameCount progression, the second section contains "global" bits, and the third section contains GBA-designed vars (or GBC WRAM vars moved into here to be script-accessible)
