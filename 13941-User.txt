N0:0x002ab4:"Script_Treasure [40 bytes of bitfield]\r\nThis struct contains data for all the treasure chests that can be found in the game. The corresponding bit is set if the corresponding chest is open. There are many bits that are unused, for the following reasons:\r\n1) The GBA developers simply copied the list of variables from the GBC game (the first 36 or so bytes of this struct copy the list almost exactly in the same order as the GBC game), and there are many chests that were removed during the GBC development following design changes, but they were never purged from the GBC source code. These bits were therefore unused in the GBC game, and are also unused in the GBA game.\r\n2) The GBC game sometimes ran special code for treasure chests that had special implementation details. The GBA chests are more limited, strictly opening and giving an item with no further scripting. Therefore, these vars, though used in the GBC game, are unused in the GBA version and a second copy of the var is instead used in Script_SaveBits to control a custom object that pretends to look like a chest.\r\n3) Sometimes the GBA developers got tired of trying to follow the GBC order, and simply duplicated all the vars in their own order, leaving the original vars unused.\r\n4) The GBA team also created chests containing a Null item that is always opened by created variables that are always set to open.\r\n\r\nSet if Treasure has been opened\r\nFormatted as follows:\r\n0xBitmask Variable = Location - Loot\r\n\r\nThe bitmask is surrounded by parenthesis ( ) when the bit is actually unused in the game\r\nVariable names enclosed in square brackets are GBA-exclusive\r\nAll bits are reset on boot/new game, unless otherwise specified for null chests.\r\nNote that the bit order in the source code might be opposite of what you might expect: it goes from most significant bit to least significant bit (i.e. 0x80 -> 0x01)\r\n\r\n(0x80) NRMGLADE01_Chest1 = Non-existant chest with Baloo Leaf\r\n(0x40) NRMVASH04_Chest1 = Undefined\r\n0x20 NRMVASH15_Chest1 = Vash Naroom - Orwin's - Archaic Leaf\r\n0x10 NRMVASH19_Chest1 = Vash Naroom - first room southeast - Baloo Leaf\r\n0x08 NRMVASH14_Chest2 = Vash Naroom - Tryn's - Remedy Drink (n.b., order changed with next bit compared to GBC)\r\n(0x04) NRMVASH14_Chest1 = Undefined\r\n0x02 NRMRIVER02_Chest1 = Naroom Grove - Left - Rune of Might\r\n0x01 NRMRIVER02_Chest2 = Naroom Grove - Right - Bark Thimble"
