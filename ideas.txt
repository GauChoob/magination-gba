Great Furok:
03002B1B == 2 and Creature0's ID = Furok? Restrict to GC == 2 also?

Naroom Forest northeast corner - chest is empty?? Maybe it's cancelled out on game init?
Weave on the hill - empty?

Use Battle_Run_Enable + Battle_Exit_Code to determine when you win boss fights!

Memory finder:
1) Hotspot/Scene ID
2) Ring most recently crafted (or else looks at delta totalrings + point to last creature's ID - works equally well I guess)


New achievements:
Open all chests
Get all spells
Get Wence's arrow
Opening chests - pair with scene id
GameCount == 0 means no save state loaded. Might need to combine with invalid scene count.
Check for game resets via losing, winning
Does not seem to have any Konami code
